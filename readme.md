# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Dataset using Neural Network
This was a collaborative project along many others participants, whilst I was interning in the role of a Research Intern under Ms. Lalita Chamarthi at Sri Venkateswara College, Delhi University. The primary goals were a) to analyze which machine learning model is best suited to do Sentiment Analysis for larger purposes, and b) Social Media Sentiment Analysis to predict (through analysis of tweets and messages) whether or not a person was in distress. Different models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVMs, ANNs, and more were trained on variety of datasets. 

My contribution was to create an artificial neural network using the IMDb Reviews Dataset. <br>

The NLP model used is the Bag of Words Model.
